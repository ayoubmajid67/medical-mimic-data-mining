New Beginning – Building a Medical Data Mining Project 🚀

Today, I’m thrilled to share a personal project that has been a deep dive into Data Engineering: **Medical Mimic Data Mining**.

I decided to take the raw, complex **MIMIC-III** clinical dataset and build a production-grade Data Warehouse from scratch to explore the full potential of data-driven healthcare systems.

The idea is to build a full data-driven system:
*   **Data Warehouse** (Current Focus)
*   **AI-Models Cluster**
*   **Full Stack App** for visualization

💡 **What this project represents for me:**
*   A commitment to mastering the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
*   Building scalable pipelines that handle messy, real-world data.
*   Applying strict **Software Engineering** principles to Data Science.
*   Translating raw logs into life-saving clinical insights.

🌐 **What the project includes:**
*   **Bronze Layer:** Strict ingestion of 16+ clinical tables.
*   **Silver Layer:** Cleaning, Unit Standardization & Logic Enrichment.
*   **Gold Layer:** Star Schema modeling for Business Intelligence.
*   **Dockerized Infrastructure:** Portable and reproducible environment.
*   **Analytics:** Deep dive into ICU utilization, Sepsis indicators, and Antibiotic resistance.

This is just the first step. The foundation is laid for future AI/ML models.

📈 **Current Milestone:** GOLD LAYER COMPLETE! ✅
The system is fully operational with clean Python-based ETL pipelines and comprehensive reports.

I highly invite you to **collaborate** to expand this project and complete the full idea!
