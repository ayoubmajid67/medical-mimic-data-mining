Subject: Final Project Submission - Data Mining (5IIR16) - Medical Data Warehouse

Dear Professor Achraf Lyazidi,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to formally submit the final project for the "Contrôle de Matière de Data Mining" (5IIR16).

**Project Title:** Medical Mimic Data Mining - End-to-End Data Warehouse
**Team Members (Binome):**
*   Ayoub Majjid
*   Ayman El Hilali

We are pleased to announce that we have successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive Data Warehouse solution using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold). This project transforms raw MIMIC-III clinical data into actionable business intelligence and AI-ready features.

**Key Deliverables:**
1.  **Technical Report:** A detailed breakdown of the architecture, data modeling, and analysis (attached).
2.  **Source Code:** Fully open-source and documented on GitHub.
    *   **Repository:** [https://github.com/ayoubmajid67/medical-mimic-data-mining](https://github.com/ayoubmajid67/medical-mimic-data-mining)

We successfully implemented:
*   **Bronze Layer:** Robust ingestion of CSV data with strict typing.
*   **Silver Layer:** Data cleaning, unit standardization, and event merging.
*   **Gold Layer:** Star Schema modeling for high-performance analytics.
*   **BI & AI:** Patient demographics, ICU performance metrics, and strategic business recommendations.

We deeply appreciate your guidance throughout this course, which gave us the theoretical foundation to build this system. We decided to keep the repository open-source to help future students and the community.

Thank you for your time and mentorship.

Sincerely,

Ayoub Majjid & Ayman El Hilali
EMSI - 5IIR16
